# Sparta Global Academy Homework- Design An Instagram Page

## Project Review:##

### In this project I have created a webpage based on Instagram's Front Page. By using the HTML/CSS tools I have been able to create a basic structure emulating how the structure of the website is displayed.



## Using CSS tools such as:
```css
p {font-size:20px;}

#mainPage{border-radius: 30px;}

.footer {background-color: grey;}
```

### It was possible to change features on the website to replicate the official website. The "font-size" allowed text to be manipulated into the size desired. The "Main Page" was structured using an id layout with div it was possible to position each section of the page correctly. The Class syntax was used to change aspects of any item inside that boundary.###

### Skills that were developed through this process included:

* Page Layout
* Position of items
* Interactive Features
* Exploring how the functions can manipulate text/objects presented on the screen.
